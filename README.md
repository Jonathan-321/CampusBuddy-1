### Key Files

- `main.dart`: Application entry point and dependency injection
- `config/router/app_router.dart`: Route definitions using GoRouter
- `presentation/blocs/events/events_bloc.dart`: State management for events
- `domain/entities/event.dart`: Core event entity model

## Architecture

CampusBuddy-1 follows a clean architecture approach with BLoC pattern for state management:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components and BLoC implementations
- **Domain Layer**: Entities and use cases that define the core business logic
- **Data Layer**: Repositories and data sources

### State Management

The application uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage state:

- **Events**: Represent user actions or system events
- **States**: Represent the current state of the application
- **BLoCs**: Process events and emit new states

## Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains production-ready code
2. **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
3. **Pull Requests**: Open a PR for review before merging into main

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the following format for branch names:
- `feature/short-description` - For new features
- `bugfix/short-description` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/short-description` - For urgent fixes
- `refactor/short-description` - For code refactoring

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Reference issues when appropriate ("Fix #123: Add event filtering")
